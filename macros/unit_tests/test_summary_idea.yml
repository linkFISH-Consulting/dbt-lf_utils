      Example test that uses dbts unit testing framework, but keeps the logic
      and asserts all inside the sql. inputs and expects are dummies in the yml.
      https://github.com/yu-iskw/dbt-unittest
      Problem is, that we can only test jinja-logic, because evaluations that
      take place on the backend cannot go back into the jinja-level (which is where
      the asserts of the dbt-unittest package take place)
    given:
      # we cannot skip the input argument, even when we define them manually in
      # in the model
      - input: ref('_dummy_source')
        rows: []
    overrides:
      vars:
        raise_on_error: false
    expect:
      rows:
        - { all_passed: 1, message: NULL}
