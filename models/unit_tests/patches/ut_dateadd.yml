    description: |
      These tests check that dbt built-in dateadd works on our backends,
      at least with the dateparts `day`, `month`, `year`.
    given:
      # we cannot skip the input argument, even when we define them manually in
      # in the model
      - input: ref('_dummy_source')
        rows:
          # the macro cannot read the format from column, so we have to set
          # inputs in the ut_ sql. however, still need to provide values!
          - {date_col: "2021-01-01", datetime_col: "2021-01-01 01:01:01"}
    expect:
      rows:
        - {output: "2021-01-02"}
        - {output: "2021-01-02 01:01:01"}
        - {output: "2021-02-01"}
