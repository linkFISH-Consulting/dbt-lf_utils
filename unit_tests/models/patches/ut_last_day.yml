      Let's avoid (our custom) eomonth, and use dbt.last_day instead.
      But this test confirms that last_day works on our backends as expected :)
    given:
      # we cannot skip the input argument, even when we define them manually in
      # in the model
      - input: ref('_dummy_source')
        rows:
          # the macro cannot read the format from column, so we have to set
          # inputs in the ut_ sql. however, still need to provide values!
          - {date_col: "2021-01-01", datetime_col: "2021-01-01 01:01:01"}
    expect:
      rows:
        - {output: "2021-01-31"}
        - {output: "2021-01-31 00:00:00"}
